        <h2>Business Models</h2>
        <p>Sixth Star Technologies utilizes time tested and perfect business models to effectively deliver solutions in line with client necessities. We follow only the best strategies and policies to offer the right business models for our diverse range of clients. Sometimes, clients do not have a picture of the right business model in their minds. At this juncture, we recommend the right business model after we carefully inspect the strategy required to execute the project, the resources needed to allot to the project and the amount of time that will be spent on it. Accordingly, we advise the client to utilize one of the following models.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="row business-models-content-row">
        <div className="col-sm business-models-content-column1">
        <h2>Predetermined Price Approach</h2>
        <p>If the system requirements are clearly defined at the outset, then this is the ideal option that can be taken up by the client. At SixthStar, we quote a specific price within which we carry out the entire project development. This option provides a low risk alternative for the client as we guarantee the delivery of the project on time within the budget limits as specified by the client. This model logically explains the costs involved and deliverables to be expected. For any changes that can occur later during the project execution, the client is charged a rate that has been previously discussed and negotiated upon.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="col-sm business-models-content-column2">
        <h2>Time and Material Approach</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, it happens that the client is not sure or it is not so easy to define the scope and the specification of the project at the initial phase. In this case, the time and material approach becomes the right option. Under this option, the client pays according to the number of man-hours that are put into the project. Later on, if the scope and project specifications are determined then the fixed priced approach can be selected. We thoroughly ensure complete transparency to report the exact number of hours that we dedicate to your project and still no complaints and good reviews from the customer.</p>

        <h2>
          Methodology
        </h2>

        <p>Sixth Star Technologies methodology as an alternate delivery process, based on response and feedback received from clients. In this methodology, once the preliminary requirements are clarified, a suitable project team is allocated for the project. The next step is to quickly build the prototype of the products. From then on, it is the continuing evolution of this prototype until it becomes the final product, fitting exactly to the needs of the client.

Sixthstar has been, since its first day, dedicated to defining projects through comprehensive functional and technical specifications. Anyway, we realize the importance of keeping the right balance between the competing demands of a rigorous process and the present day software scenario. Our process is focused on making the right product using the right technologies.<b/></p>
      <p>The product has to be delivered on time and on budget. Therefore to ensure the timely and quality delivery for 100% client satisfaction we implement the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <i class="fa-brands fa-squarespace"></i> We use to make flexible policies for faster growth of our internal working environment as well as our external outsourcing business.</li>
        <li><i class="fa-brands fa-squarespace"></i> Our processes and methods are easy to implement and for optimum utilization of company resources.</li>
        <li><i class="fa-brands fa-squarespace"></i> Our Methodology of depicted services are well coped up with client demands as they are very elastic.</li>
        <li><i class="fa-brands fa-squarespace"></i> Appropriate combination between fix methodological rules and flexible aspects of company rules in providing outsourcing services.</li>
